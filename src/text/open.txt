The year 2028...
A conflict between
the Earth and the
<12>
other planets has
led the worlds to 
the edge of a final
<13>
war which threatens
man's very survival.
In a struggle to end
<14>
the conflict, the
confederation has
developed a
<15>
revolutionary land-
sea-air-space unit 
in a top secret
<16>
operation.
Due to the fact that
this unit looks like
<17>
a fire-spitting angel
its code name is 
'Arch Angel'.
